# Pulseq-zero: Automatic optimization of pulseq MRI sequences


## Summary (290 / 300 characters)

We combine our efficient and fully differentiable MR simulation with a modified version of pypulseq to allow optimization of any pulseq sequence script. Requiring nothing more than the difinition of optimization parameters and a loss function, any imaging properties can be achieved easily.
